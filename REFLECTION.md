# Reflection – readingTracker.js

**1. What was the most helpful aspect of this code’s structure?**

The clear use of functions and consistent naming made it easy to follow.  
The structure of `readingLog` as an array of objects was intuitive and realistic for tracking weekly data.

---

**2. What part was confusing or took longer to understand?**

The `mostReadBook` function took a bit longer to understand at first.  
Specifically, counting frequency using an object and then looping again to find the max value required close attention.

---

**3. What did I learn while working on this?**

I learned how to use loops with objects and arrays together.  
Also, I practiced writing function summaries and explaining code clearly using inline comments.

---

**4. What improvement did I suggest in the code?**

I suggested that the `mostReadBook()` function could be improved to handle ties,  
in case multiple books were read the same number of times.

---

**5. What test case did I add?**

I added a test case at the bottom of the code to log reading on **Sunday** with `"The Hobbit"`  
and then print the updated daily summary.
